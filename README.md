**A lifesaving (or at least, License saving) app for drunk math haters**

## **🎭 The Story Behind This App**

While growing up in Denmark, I made a lot of Danish friends. But hanging out with them made me realize one thing:
**Danish people probably drink more alcohol than water.** 😱

Fast forward to today, and I’ve seen many people (including myself sometimes... hehe 🍺) going out drinking **in freezing cold weather**. ❄️🍻

The problem? **Going back home.**

Taxis are expensive. Walking in -10°C feels like a punishment from Odin himself. And that’s when the **drunken idea** of driving home sneaks into your brain. BUT Denmark has a strict rule: **Your blood alcohol level must be under 0.5‰ to drive.**

How do you check that?  
With **MATH** (ughh 🤮).

**But let's be honest... when you're drunk, solving math formulas is harder than quantum physics.**

## **🥂 Introducing... The Blood Alcohol Calculator!**
This **magical app** lets you enter your drinking details and tells you **whether it’s safe to drive or if you should start looking for a couch to crash on.**

**Could it save lives?** Maybe.
**Could it save you from a DUI?** Probably.
**Will it stop you from making bad drunk decisions?** Absolutely not.

- Enter your **weight**, **gender**, and **drinks consumed**.
- The app does **math sorcery** behind the scenes.
- You get your **estimated blood alcohol level (‰)** and **a warning if you're over the limit**.
- If it's **above 0.5‰**, **put the car keys down and find a warm blanket.** 🚫🚗

## **💻 How to Use It?**  

- **Download the latest `.exe` file** from the [Releases](https://github.com/Niracash/BloodAlcoholCalculator/releases)
- **Run the `.exe`** (it’s portable, no installation needed!).
- **Windows will freak out** because I didn’t pay for a certificate (no money no honey 💸). So click **"More info"** > **"Run anyway"**.
- **Enter your info and find out if you should drive or call a cab!**

Stay safe, and **drink responsibly!** 🍷🍺  
**Made with love, beer, and bad math skills.**
